# Analyzing the famous iris data set which is a multivariate data set
# introduces by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
#
# The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of iris (Iris setosa, iris vitginica
# and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. 
#
# Four features were measured from each sample^ the length and the width of the sepals and petals
# in centimeters.
